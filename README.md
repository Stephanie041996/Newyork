# Floating and positioning project

This Is the floating and positionaing project for microverse 2.0 curriculum. in this project I have used HTML and CSS to make a clone of the New York Page given in the following link. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0
I am using float grid and flex and any options I choose to layout and style the options to appear like on the page.
